### 🎯 **Expected Results**

- ✅ "Session Type" error should be resolved

- ✅ Application should load sessions successfully
- ✅ Only valid, existing fields are being fetched and displayed

### 📊 **Data Impact**

- **Before**: Fetching 25 fields (20 invalid, 5 valid)
- **After**: Fetching 9 fields (all valid)
- **Reduction**: 64% fewer fields fetched
- **Added**: 2 new valid fields (Moderator, Web Publishing Status)

### 🔍 **Next Steps**

2. Verify that sessions load correctly
3. Check that all components render properly with the reduced field set
4. Consider adding more useful fields from the available Airtable fields list if needed
