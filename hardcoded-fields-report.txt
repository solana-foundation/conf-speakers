Most hardcoded fields are either:
1. Operational/venue information that may not change between events
2. Placeholder links that need to be replaced with actual URLs
3. Contact information that could be centralized

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

1. Consider adding Airtable fields for:
   - Venue location and stage details
   - Speaker lounge location
   - Contact email addresses
   - Various URL fields for forms, galleries, and downloads

2. Create a "Settings" or "Configuration" table in Airtable for event-wide information that doesn't change per speaker

3. Replace all "#" placeholder links with actual URLs or Airtable field references

4. Consider making contact information (like events@solana.org) configurable through environment variables or Airtable
